## Run with Docker

With **[Docker](https://www.docker.com)**, you can quickly build and run the entire application in minutes :whale:

```shell
# 1. First, clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/VMAG-combat/dockrized-neural-photo-editor-using-GAN
$ cd dockrized-neural-photo-editor-using-GAN

# 2. Build Docker image
$ docker build -t dockrized_neural_photo_editor_using_GAN .

# 3. Run!
$ docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 dockrized_neural_photo_editor_using_GAN
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and wait till the webpage is loaded.

## Local Installation

It's easy to install and run it on your computer.

```shell
# 1. First, clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/VMAG-combat/dockrized-neural-photo-editor-using-GAN
$ cd dockrized-neural-photo-editor-using-GAN

# 2. Install Python packages
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Customization

It's also easy to customize and include your models in this app.

<details>
 <summary>Details</summary>

### Use your own model

Place your trained `.h5` file saved by `model.save()` under models directory.


### Use other pre-trained model

See [Keras applications](https://keras.io/applications/) for more available models such as DenseNet, MobilNet, NASNet, etc.


### UI Modification

Modify files in `templates` and `static` directory.

`index.html` for the UI and `main.js` for all the behaviors.

## Deployment

To deploy it for public use, you need to have a public **linux server**.
